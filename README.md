# Autour

Test development for Autour, a "get-me-out-of-here" travel app that finds destinations you can fly to based on your budget and travel dates. The app uses Node.js, Express.js, AngularJS and Twitter Bootstrap. 

## Getting started 

1. Install the latest stable version of [Node.js] (https://nodejs.org/en/download/). *To check if Node.js is installed type `node -v` in Terminal/Command Prompt. If installed, it should show the installed Node version.*
2. Install `npm` if not installed already (Node.js installation usually includes `npm`). *To check if `npm` is installed type `npm -v` in Terminal/Command Prompt. If installed, it should show the installed `npm` version.*
